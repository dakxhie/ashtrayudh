      <h2>💻 Building Tipply — The App that Empowers Creators</h2>
      <p>
        Tipply began as a small experiment: what if engagement could be rewarding and positive?
        Over time, it grew into a platform that gives creators real power — not just attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every button, animation, and rule was built with care.
        Behind the smooth UI are countless hours of testing, optimizing, and dreaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tipply isn’t just an app — it’s our message to creators: your time and energy matter.
