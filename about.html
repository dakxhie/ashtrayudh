        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Vortix is a small, focused creative studio dedicated to building digital experiences
            that feel personal, meaningful, and beautifully simple.  
            We design apps, write thoughtful content, and craft ideas that connect with people in a genuine way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our philosophy is rooted in calm design — interfaces that breathe, writing that flows,
            and products that respect both attention and time.  
            Everything we create is shaped with intention: clarity, elegance, and purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Work</h2>
        <p>
            We work across three main verticals:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile Apps</strong> — beautiful, minimal products built for real human use.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative Writing</strong> — stories, essays, and blogs that inspire thought and imagination.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Identity</strong> — crafting modern, aesthetic web experiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Vortix — Our Upcoming App</h2>
        <p>
            We’re currently working on <strong>Vortix</strong>, a new digital engagement platform built to help
            creators grow, connect, and showcase their work in an organic, meaningful way.  
            It’s still in development and not released yet — but it represents everything we believe in:
            simplicity, expressive design, and empowering users.
        </p>

        <p>
            Vortix is not just a tool — it’s a space for creativity to breathe.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We believe technology should feel warm, approachable, and human.  
            Every design choice, from color tone to typography to animation, should make the user feel at ease.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it’s an app or an article, our goal is the same:  
            <strong>create small, meaningful moments of clarity.</strong>
        </p>
