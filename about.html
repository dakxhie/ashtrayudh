    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ashtrayudh</strong> is a studio of ideas — a place where technology, design, and emotion meet.
      We build digital experiences and stories that remind people that creativity can be calm, and innovation can be kind.

      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        We believe creation should feel meaningful. Every app we build and every story we tell is crafted to
        connect — not to overwhelm. We see design as a language that can soothe, not shout.

      <h3>What We Create</h3>
      <p>
        From thoughtful mobile apps like <strong>Vortix</strong> to written pieces that explore creativity and balance,
        Ashtrayudh blends technology and storytelling. We don’t just make things; we make moments.

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        To build a digital space where every interaction feels human.  
        A space that listens, not just responds.  
        A space that stays elegant, warm, and unforgettable.
