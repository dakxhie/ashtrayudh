            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Astrayudh is a small, focused creative studio dedicated to building digital experiences
                that feel personal, meaningful, and beautifully simple. We design apps, write thoughtful content, 
                and craft ideas that connect with people in a genuine way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our philosophy is rooted in **calm design** — interfaces that breathe, writing that flows,
                and products that respect both attention and time.
                Everything we create is shaped with intention: clarity, elegance, and purpose.

            <h2>Our Work</h2>
            <p>
                We work across three main verticals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile Apps</strong> — beautiful, minimal products built for real human use.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Writing</strong> — stories, essays, and blogs that inspire thought and imagination.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Identity</strong> — crafting modern, aesthetic web experiences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Vortix — Our Upcoming App</h2>
            <p>
                We’re currently working on **Vortix**, a new digital engagement platform built to help
                creators grow, connect, and showcase their work in an organic, meaningful way.
                It’s still in development and not released yet — but it represents everything we believe in:
                simplicity, expressive design, and empowering users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vortix is not just a tool — it’s a space for creativity to breathe.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We believe technology should feel warm, approachable, and human.
                Every design choice, from color tone to typography to animation, should make the user feel at ease.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it’s an app or an article, our goal is the same:
                **create small, meaningful moments of clarity.**
