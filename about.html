      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        Astrayudh is a creative collective focused on building thoughtful digital experiences.
        We blend design, storytelling, and development to create products that truly feel alive.
        Every project begins with curiosity — the kind that challenges the ordinary.

      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        We believe simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  
        Our process is not about doing more, but doing meaningfully.  
        Whether it’s writing a blog or crafting an app interface, we care about how it feels, not just how it looks.

      <h3>The Way We Work</h3>
      <p>
        Astrayudh operates with calm energy — quietly driven by purpose.  
        We focus on clarity, aesthetics, and balance.  
        Our work is deeply rooted in respect for the user’s time and emotion.

      <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t just build; we tell stories.  
        Our apps, like <strong>Vortix</strong>, are born from real moments, crafted for real people.  
        Every tap, scroll, and interaction carries intent — and a hint of elegance.
