      <h3>Vortix</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Vortix</strong> is our upcoming experience-driven platform designed for creators and audiences to truly connect.
        It transforms how people engage with digital content — replacing noise with flow, and routine with meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every interaction in Vortix is guided by balance.  
        You earn attention by giving it. You rise by engaging with intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently in active development, <strong>Vortix</strong> is a reflection of what we stand for — technology that listens before it speaks.
